# Udemy Notes Template

### Store your Udemy notes offline for your own convenience

**Reason:** At the time of this writing, Udemy does not have a way to download notes. Additionally, Udemy does not have a way for instructors to easily update their courses, so instructors may often have to delete most/all of their lectures in order to replace them with updated ones. The problem is that ALL bookmark notes associated with each lecture will be deleted forever, which is incredibly painful if you take hundreds of neat notes on Udemy.

**What I did:** Thus, I created a way to quickly and easily store Udemy notes offlineâ€”I replicated the bookmark styles and figured out how to set up a template HTML file; the notes rendered in the browser are pretty much exactly how the look on Udemy with their branding as of this writing. This was entirely for my sake because I obviously did not want to lose the hundreds of notes I had taken on a course that was about to be completely overhauled, but other students are affected by this as well, so I might as well share.\
I tried to cut out as much unnecessary code from the HTML and CSS as possible (how it looked in the beginning was an absolute disaster), but feel free to make it neater if you wish.

**NOTE:** Currently, I have not incorporated the styles associated with the Styles options (Normal text, Quote, Heading 4) on the notes because I never use those.
