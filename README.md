# Udemy Notes Template

### Store your Udemy notes offline for your own convenience

**Reason:** At the time of this writing, Udemy does not have a way to download notes. Additionally, Udemy does not have a way for instructors to easily update their courses, so instructors may often have to delete most/all of their lectures in order to replace them with updated ones. The problem is that ALL bookmark notes associated with each lecture will be deleted forever, which is incredibly painful if you take hundreds of neat notes on Udemy.

**What I did:** Thus, I created a way to quickly and easily store Udemy notes offlineâ€”I copied the CSS stylesheets by looking at the Network requests via Chrome Devtools, and I set up a template HTML file stripped down to just enough needed to show the notes. The notes rendered in the browser are pretty much exactly how they look on Udemy with their branding as of this writing.\
My goal was purely to find a way to store my notes with 0 ties to the internet, so feel free to make the code neater and add features on your own if you wish.

**NOTE:** In case it was not clear, this is just a way to STORE notes. I removed the buttons associated with deleting, adding, and editing notes, and the bookmarks do not link back to the lecture videos (though the timestamps are still there); any changes like that will have to be done on your own.
