# Udemy Notes Template

### Store your Udemy notes offline for your own convenience

**Reason:** At the time of this writing, Udemy does not have a way to download notes. Additionally, Udemy does not have a way for instructors to easily update their courses, so instructors may often have to delete most/all of their lectures in order to replace them with updated ones. The problem is that ALL bookmark notes associated with each lecture will be deleted forever, which is incredibly painful if you take hundreds of neat notes on Udemy.

**What I did:** Thus, I created a way to quickly and easily store Udemy notes offlineâ€”I replicated the bookmark styles and figured out how to set up a template HTML file; the notes rendered in the browser are pretty much exactly how the look on Udemy with their branding as of this writing.\
I tried to cut out as much unnecessary code from the HTML and CSS as possible (how it looked in the beginning was an absolute disaster), but my goal was purely to find a way to store my notes with 0 ties to the internet, so feel free to make it neater if you wish.

**NOTE:** Currently, I have not incorporated the styles associated with the Styles options (Normal text, Quote, and Heading 4) on the notes because I never use those.\
Also, in case it was not clear, this is just a way to STORE notes. I removed the buttons associated with deleting, adding, and editing notes, and the bookmarks do not link back to the lecture videos (though the timestamps are still there); any changes like that will have to be done on your own.
